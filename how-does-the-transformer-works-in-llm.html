  The Transformer is an architecture that uses a different approach called "self-attention" to process the input
  sequence. Here's a simplified explanation of how the Transformer works:

  Input Embedding: The input sequence is first converted into a set of embeddings, which are high-dimensional vectors
  that represent each word in the sequence.

  Self-Attention: The Transformer then uses self-attention to calculate a weighted representation of each word in the
  input sequence based on the other words in the sequence. This allows the model to focus on the most relevant words for
  each output.

  Encoder: The output of the self-attention layer is then fed into multiple layers of feedforward neural networks to
  generate a final encoding of the input sequence. This encoding captures the relevant information from the input
  sequence and is used to generate the output sequence.

  Decoder: The decoder takes the encoding from the encoder and uses it to generate the output sequence. It also uses
  self-attention to calculate the most relevant parts of the output sequence at each step.

  Output: The final output of the model is generated by a softmax function, which produces a probability distribution
  over the possible outputs. The output with the highest probability is then selected as the final output of the model.

  Overall, the Transformer is a powerful architecture that allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the
  input and output sequences, without being limited by the fixed order of the traditional models. This allows the model
  to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several natural language processing tasks.

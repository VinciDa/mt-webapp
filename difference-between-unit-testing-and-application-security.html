  Difference between unit testing and integration testing  In software development,
  testing is an essential part of the process of creating a reliable and effective product.
  However, there are different types of testing that serve different purposes and goals.

  Unit testing can be seen as an exercise in reductionism, where the focus is on breaking down a complex system into
  its individual parts and testing each part in isolation. This approach is inspired by the idea that a complex system

  can be understood by studying its constituent elements. The goal of unit testing is to ensure that each individual
  unit or component of the software behaves correctly according to its design specifications. Integration testing,
  on the other hand, can be seen as an exercise in holistic thinking, where the focus is on testing how different
  components of the software work together as a whole. This approach is inspired by the idea that a complex system is
  more than the sum of its parts and that understanding the interactions between the parts is crucial to ensuring the
  system's proper functioning. The goal of integration testing is to ensure that the different components of the
  software
  integrate correctly and produce the desired results when combined. In a way, unit testing and integration testing
  represent
  two different ways of thinking about software development: reductionism and holism. While both approaches have
  their strengths and weaknesses, a balanced approach that combines both reductionist and holistic thinking can lead to
  the development of more reliable and effective software systems.

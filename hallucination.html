  A hallucination is a phenomenon in which an individual perceives something external to them that does not actually
  exist in the physical world. In a large language model, this phenomenon occurs when a neural network is trained to
  produce certain linguistic outputs. The neural network may generate outputs that are not present in the training
  corpus or that are semantically inconsistent with the given context. This can lead to the neural network producing
  outputs that appear to be realistic but are in fact not actually present in the real world. For example, the model may
  produce an output such as "There are flying cars in the sky." Although this output may sound realistic, it is not
  actually true.

  here's an example of a hallucination in a language model:

  Input prompt: "What is the capital of France?"

  Hallucinated response: "The capital of France is London."

  In this example, the language model generated a response that is not accurate or relevant to the input provided. The
  model has hallucinated the answer by mistakenly outputting the capital of the United Kingdom instead of France. This
  kind of error can occur if the language model is not adequately trained on the correct data or if the model has not
  been able to understand the input properly.
